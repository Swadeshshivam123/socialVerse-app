//Using MongoDB, Mongoose and Robo3T(Studio3T)(GUI for visualizing mongoDB database) for the 'database-creation'

//Acquire the mongoose library
const mongoose = require('mongoose');

//Connect mongoose to the database that we want to create('socialverse_development')
mongoose.connect("mongodb://localhost/socialverse_development");

//Acquire the connection in 'db' variable to check if it is successfully connected or not
const db = mongoose.connection;

//Throwing an error message on the cnsole if 'db' is not successfully connected to the database
db.on("error", console.error.bind(console, 'Error connecting to db'));

//Once 'db' is open, then throw a message that it is successfuly connected to the database
db.once('open', function(){
    console.log("Successfully connected to the database :: MongoDB");
});

//Exporting this module to be further used by main 'index.js' file (if needed)
module.exports = db;
